# About the project

I stumbled upon this course in an email that listed various phd-courses and found it useful! I did use R in one project some years ago, but I really have to refresh my memory before I get back to speed with that. 
Even though I don't use R or Github currently in my phd project, I am certain that both tools will become very handy (probably essential) in the future projects. 

A link to my Github Repository:

```{r}
date()
```
Exercise 1  file feels definitely a practical approach to introduce oneself to R. Personally I am looking forward to more technical exercises, as I feel that the syntax is easiest to grasp when you really have to work on a specific problem. 
I'm curious that what is the role of the Personal Access Token? Couldn't I upload my work to github without it? 

*one minute intro for R Markdown is great!*
