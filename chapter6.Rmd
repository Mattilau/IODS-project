# Exercise 6

In the first part of the exercise 6, we study some data from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats (Crowder and Hand, 1990). The three groups were put on different diets, and each animalâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately weekly, except in week seven when two recordings were taken) over a 9-week period. 

```{r}
library(tidyr); library(dplyr); library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
RATSL <- read_csv("data/RATSL.csv")
RATSL$Group <- factor(RATSL$Group)
RATSL$ID <- factor(RATSL$ID)
glimpse(RATSL)
head(RATSL)
tail(RATSL)
```

**Let us begin our analysis by plotting the weight development of each individual differentiated by their diet groups:**


```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = Weight, linetype = ID))
p2 <- p1 + geom_line() + scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4))
p3 <- p2 + facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both)
p4 <- p3 + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "none")
p5 <- p4 + theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
p6 <- p5 + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(RATSL$Weight), max(RATSL$Weight)))
p6
```

Next, let us standardize the data so that the initial weight does not skew the results:


```{r}
# Standardise the scores:
RATSL <- RATSL %>%
  group_by(Time) %>%
  mutate( stdweight = (Weight - mean(Weight))/sd(Weight) ) %>%
  ungroup()
glimpse(RATSL)

p1 <- ggplot(RATSL, aes(x = Time, y = stdweight, linetype = ID))
p2 <- p1 + geom_line() + scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4))
p3 <- p2 + facet_grid(. ~ Group, labeller = label_both)
p4 <- p3 + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "none")
p5 <- p4 + theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
p6 <- p5 + scale_y_continuous(name = "standardized weight")
p6
```

Here are the standardized datapoints graphed. Now I have to stop and focus on my 32-hours old, first-born baby. Thank you for the course!
